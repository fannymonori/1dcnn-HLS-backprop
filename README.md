# 1DCNN-HLS-Backprop

This repository contains the Vitis HLS implementation of training 1D-CNN networks.
- fpga-only: This folder contains the HLS code for creating a hardware design that runs the training of a small 1-dimensional convolutional network fully on the FPGA.
- fpga-cpu: This folder contains the HLS code for a hardware design that is more general, and can run many network configurations.
